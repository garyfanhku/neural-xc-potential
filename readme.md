## Introduction

This repository stores the references relevant to [[Toward-the-Exact-Exchangeâ€“Correlation-Potential]]

A nice citation graph for [[Toward-the-Exact-Exchangeâ€“Correlation-Potential]] can be found [here](https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/d0b44b4f66dcc549ebf40395450520578d8859c0/Toward-the-Exact-ExchangeCorrelation-Potential-a-3D-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Construct/graph)

## Repository management

Although it is perfectly fine to directly modify `.md` files using whatever markdown editors you are familiar with, using [foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) will enable more powerful features such as wiki-links and note graphs.

## Repository structure

- Journals like [[2021-03-04]] is used for house-keeping.
- Action items can be found at [[todo]] (maintenance stuff, non-academic).
- [[inbox]] stores unfiltered unorganized raw information/references, which will later on be organized and put into corresponding references.
