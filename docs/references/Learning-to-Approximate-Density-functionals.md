"Learning to Approximate Density Functionals" appears on Accounts of Chemical Research https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.accounts.0c00742
We detail our efforts in 4 papers from the first prototype [[Kohn-Sham-Equations-as-Regularizer]] https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.253002, to our recent work on blurring the edge between ML and DFT https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.036401
