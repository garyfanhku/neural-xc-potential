Recently, Nagai et al. [10] reported on successfully representing the xc functional as
a neural network [[Completing-dft-by-ml]], trained to fit 2 different properties of 3
molecules using the three-dimensional KS-DFT calculation in PySCF [11] via gradient-less optimization. While
their results show promise in predicting various material
properties, gradient-less methods in training neural networks typically suffer from bad convergence [12] and are
too computationally intensive to scale to larger and more
complex neural networks.
