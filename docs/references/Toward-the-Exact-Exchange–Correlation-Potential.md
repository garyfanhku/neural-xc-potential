In principle, the determination of the potential at any ri, vxc(ri) requires the knowledge of **global electron density
function ρ(r)**. Indeed, Nagai et al.32 [[Neural-network-Kohn-Sham-exchange-correlation-potetial]] proposed a neural network that maps ρ(r) to vxc(r) and as a proof of concept determined
the vxc(r) of a one-dimensional two-particle spinless Fermion
model via a neural network that one-to-one maps its ρ(r) to its
vxc(r). Just as other existing machine-learnt xc functionals,26,27
their approach requires the knowledge of the global electron
density function ρ(r) to determine the vxc(r)
32 and thus cannot
be applicable for large molecules as their electron density functions are not accurately known.
